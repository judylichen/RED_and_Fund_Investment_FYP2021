                      <p class="u-align-left u-large-text u-text u-text-font u-text-variant u-text-2">&nbsp;Xiaohongshu (or RED) is also becoming a popular platform for people to share and look for fund investment advice. More people, especially younger investors with little knowledge about fund investment are now seeking advice on RED. There are also lots of journal articles and reports commenting on this phenomenon with doubts and criticisms towards RED fund-related posts and its users. This project aims to study the investment behavior of the people who browse information on RED and to compare with the conclusions from some published reports. Noticing that there is a rising trend discussing fund investment on RED, the study hopes to bring a reference to investment beginners on their choice of information sources and also a primary source for further research on the RED usage and investment decisions.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p class="u-text u-text-3">Such a popular topic has aroused the attention of professionals. iResearch Consulting Group reposted a journal article from the most popular web portal about fund investment, ChinaFund.cn, criticizing the unauthorized KOLs sharing their fund investment experiences on RED and Bilibili. The article mentioned that, regarding the behavior of some fund influencers recommending funds, some voices questioned their involvement in “illegal securities investment consulting”. iResearch Consulting Group focuses on internet media, e-commerce and some other new economic fields that relate to Chinese internet industry, providing advanced market research reports and supplying online business services in China.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>Yuefeng Wu (2021), fund manager of one of the top Chinese private placement companies, Fengjing Equity, shared his opinion towards the influencers and the posts on RED and Bilibili after reading them. <font class="u-text-palette-2-dark-1"><b>“It is obvious that they are not professional. When they are explaining the terms about funds, they are not even sure about whether the content is right or wrong.”&nbsp; </b>
                        </font>Wu suggested that there are many investment beginners following the influencers decision on fund investment which is not a wise decision. He mentioned that both the&nbsp; receivers and deliverers on social media are not educated enough in finance or even certificated as a professional analyst. That is risky both financially and ethically.&nbsp; <br>
                        <br>There are few features that are worth noticing in the phenomenon of RED and fund investment. Firstly, the content of fund investment on RED is more attractive than regular financial news from the first sights. Secondly, the fund investment related posts received more views or likes on RED than regular financial news or finance reports from the banks, such as the Mar.25th fund market review from the Bank of Communication (2021).&nbsp; In order to dig deeper in the study, Cognitive Fit Theory and the Halo Effect Theory will be used as the theoretical frameworks to support the research. Respectively, these two theories will provide a solid foundation to explain the impact of different presentation types and the attractiveness of influencers on RED.<br>

But having these certificates doesn't mean a rich experience on investment. Their opinions might be right but might not be right for my portfolio.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Bloomberg is definitely the best platform for people to take reference on investment. They provide first-hand information directly from the organizations such as companies or banks. For example, Tencent will publish its report on Bloomberg first but they won't publish it to social media. As for the general public that cannot get access to it, mainstream media such as Financial Times and Wallstreet Journal are the best choices for them to take a look on making investment decidsions.

            <p class="u-text u-text-2">In this survey, the participants aged from 18 to 74, the majority of them are 21-24 years old. Most of them are female, which takes 63.40% of the total. 3 of the participants defined them as non-binary/third gender and 2 of them prefer not to tell the gender. These participants had a very diverse educational background.&nbsp; Most of them were from business and communication majors. Others include medicine, engineering and so on. The participants were mostly investment beginners. As the questionnaire result showed, around 35% of the participants think they do not have any other experience on investment apart from savings, and around 50% of them said they have little knowledge of investment and they are beginner, making investment on savings, insurance and funds, which fits the target group of the survey.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>The study tried to explore the research questions in many ways such as the platforms they use to learn fund investment, their investment experiences and so on. Below, there are some scientific statistics figuring out the relationships that the investment beginners’ behavior on RED compared with other platform users.<br>

Compared to other information sources such as financial TV programs and the finance section of newspapers or magazines, which are less appealing to beginner users, investors who use RED for information sources about finance are less likely to watch TV programs than other social media platform users. As for the comparison newspapers/magazines and other information sources, there was not a huge difference in percentages among the RED users sample group. However, apart from the descriptive statistics, the chi-square test also showed that there was no (statistically) significant difference between the social media platforms using and other traditional type of information for investment reference, respectively financial TV programs,&nbsp; X2 (1, N = 153) = 1.13, p = 0.286, Cramer’s V = .22., &nbsp;and finance section of newspapers and magazines,&nbsp; X2 (1, N = 153) = 1.13, p = 0.02, Cramer’s V = .086.&nbsp;</span>

According to the data collected, 55.5% of total participants said that they make investments hoping to earn a little bit of the money and try their best to keep its value, showing a low level of risk-taking in fund investments. As for the RED users, this percentage is a bit higher, with a number of 61.1%. Only 5.5% of the RED users saying that they are not afraid of the risk at all. Majority of the participants were still not considered as risk-taking investors in the fund investment. Also, they were not expecting the huge amount of return as the risk is getting higher with the return rising.</p>

Although the majority of the participants were amateur investors that haven't experienced investment a lot, there was still no statistical support that relationship exists between the social media use and investment experience level for investors. It is possible that professional investors browse the information on RED for investment reference. Besides, the chi-square test also showed that there was no significant difference between the social media platforms using and the understanding towards the fund investment,&nbsp; X2 (3, N = 153) = 2.521, p = 0.471, Cramer’s V = .128. No statistical relationship between the social media platforms use and investors’ knowledge of the fund. It is hard to suggest that using social media, especially RED, means a lack of knowledge of fund investment.&nbsp;</p>

Many doubts and questions from professionals were also related to the reliability of both the influencers and the content. These professionals mentioned that beginners are very easy to follow the suggestions online and that is a risky decision. Assuming that the investment-related posts on RED are regarded as not reliable compared to other social media platforms, the questionnaire asked participants’ ideas about their thoughts on taking social media posts as a reference to make investment decisions. The result shows that, actually, there was no significant difference between the social media platforms using and the reliability of the investment-related posts,&nbsp; X2 (4, N = 153) = 7.536, p = 0.110, Cramer’s V = .222. The users were able to distinguish and make their own investment decision according to these posts, regardless of RED or other social media platforms.&nbsp; Majority of the participants think that “Social media is just a platform for them to share their ideas. We can take it as a reference but not imitate them.”, with 46.4% proportion. 3.7% of the RED users agree with “We can follow their steps on making our own investment decisions.” while 1.0% of the users from other platforms agree with this statement. There was a sample size limitation plus a statistical support on no significant difference, it was still not applicable to admit that RED users tend more to blindly follow the decisions of influencers.&nbsp;</span>

Compared with mainstream media platforms, social media information of investment is lapsed. However, the result tested by this study shows that investment beginners are actually aware of the reliability of the influencers’ posts. It is necessary to set regulations towards fund investment on social media to restrict or inform the risk and avoid misleading the users. &nbsp;<br>
                    <br>In this situation, it is crucial to rethink the behaviors of  investment beginners and conduct further behavioral studies based on the new findings from this study. To develop the relative research in the future, the findings in this study provides a basic behavioral assumption of investment beginners who are less experienced and stick to social media information.&nbsp; Limitation also existed in the study.
